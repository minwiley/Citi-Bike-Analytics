## Task

**Your task in this assignment is to aggregate the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs to build a data dashboard, story, or report.  You may work with a timespan of your choosing. Optionally, you may merge multiple datasets from different periods. The following are some questions you may wish to tackle, especially if you are working with merged datasets. Do not limit yourself to these questions; they are suggestions for a starting point. Be creative!**

* How many trips have been recorded total during the chosen period?
* By what percentage has total ridership grown? 
* How has the proportion of short-term customers and annual subscribers changed?
* What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during summer months? 
* What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during winter months?
* Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? (Based on data, why do you hypothesize these are the top locations?)
* Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for ending a journey? (Based on data, why?)
* Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? (Based on data, why?)
* Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for ending a journey (Based on data, why?)
* Today, what is the gender breakdown of active participants (Male v. Female)?
* How effective has gender outreach been in increasing female ridership over the timespan?
* How does the average trip duration change by age?
* What is the average distance in miles that a bike is ridden?
* Which bikes (by ID) are most likely due for repair or inspection in the timespan? 
* How variable is the utilization by bike ID?

**Additionally, city officials would like to see the following visualizations:**

* A static map that plots all bike stations with a visual indication of the most popular locations to start and end a journey with zip code data overlaid on top.

* If you're working with a merged dataset: a dynamic map that shows how each station's popularity changes over time (by month and year) -- with commentary pointing to any interesting events that may be behind these phenomena.

**Lastly, as a chronic over-achiever:**
* Find at least two unexpected phenomena in the data and provide a visualization and analysis to document their presence. 

## Considerations

Remember, the people reading your analysis will NOT be data analysts. Your audience will be city officials, public administrators, and heads of New York City departments. Your data and analysis needs to be presented in a way that is focused, concise, easy-to-understand, and visually compelling. Your visualizations should be colorful enough to be included in press releases, and your analysis should be thoughtful enough for dictating programmatic changes. 

## Assessment

Your final product will be assessed on the following metrics: 
* Analytic Rigor
* Readability
* Visual Attraction
